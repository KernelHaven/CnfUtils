Building the JNI library for CryptoMiniSat
==========================================

(This is my first time using JNI, so please be gentle)

This README explains how I built the CryptoMiniSat (CMS) JNI library.

The Makefile in this directory builds everything that is needed. These are the two steps:

1) The header file with the correct JNI functions is generated from the Java source file using the javah tool.
2) The implementation (*.cpp) of the JNI is compiled with the generated header and the CMS library to create the final
   shared object (cryptominisat5-jni.so) in the res/ folder.

The first few lines in the Makefile contain variables that you probably want to adapt:
- JAVA_HOME should point to the Java installation directory. Inside of this there should be `include/jni.h` and
  `include/linux/`.
- CMS_DIR should point to the build directory of CryptoMiniSat. Inside of this there should be `include/cryptominisat/`
  and `lib/libcryptominisat5.a`.

The cryptominisat5-jni.so in the res/ folder is packaged into the delivered Jar, and CryptoMiniSatSolver.init() loads
it on-demand into the JVM.
